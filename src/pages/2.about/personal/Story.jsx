                    Hey there! I&apos;m your tech-Tom tour guide, navigating the
                    realms of design and development - with a hint of creativity
                    and a dash of caffeine-fueled curiosity.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Tech is my playground – I&apos;m the mate who&apos;s always
                    excited to dive in and chat about the next-gen gadgets. From
                    AI experiments to start-up development, I&apos;m all in
                    (especially when wings are involved). But hey, it&apos;s not
                    all bits and bites, I can&apos;t wait to get outside and
                    spend my time around the sand, sea, and sun!
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Speaking of coding fuel, I&apos;m a coffee enthusiast on a
                    java journey. From perfecting the pour-over ritual to
                    uncovering the best-value coffee. No coffee snobbery, just
                    keeness for the &apos;caff&apos;.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Product management is where I&apos;ve come from. I craft
                    seamless user experiences, hitting all that sweet spot
                    between design and function to deliver results that matter.
                    <br />
                    <br />I am a life-time learner, always looking to level up
                    by tackling challenges like a puzzle and turning failures
                    into fuel. Think of me as the hybrid of startup dynamism and
                    project management precision. Let&apos;s not just build
                    projects, let&apos;s build experiences. Let&apos;s talk
                    code, creativity and crafting stunning digital experiences!
